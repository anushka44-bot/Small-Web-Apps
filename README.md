# Front-End Web Apps Series

This repository is a collection of simple front-end web applications that I'm building as part of a series to improve and showcase my front-end development skills. Each project focuses on a specific concept or utility, and more apps will be added regularly.

## ðŸ”¹ Project 1: Age Calculator
