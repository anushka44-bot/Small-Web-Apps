# Front-End Web Apps Series

This repository is a collection of simple front-end web applications that I'm building as part of a series to improve and showcase my front-end development skills. Each project focuses on a specific concept or utility, and more apps will be added regularly.

## 🔹 Project 1: Age Calculator

The **Age Calculator** is the first app in this series. It takes a user's date of birth and calculates their age in years, months, and days.

This project has not been deployed yet.

## 🔹 Project 5: Quiz App

The **Quiz App** is a general-purpose quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge on various topics. Users can answer multiple-choice questions, see their scores, and track their progress.

This project has not been deployed yet.

## 🔹 Project 6: Landing Page

The **Landing Page** is a simple responsive homepage with an interactive background. The background cycles through three different images automatically, and users can manually switch between them using dot navigation. There is also a play/pause button that allows users to control a background video. As the background changes, the text content on the page updates accordingly.

This project has not been deployed yet.

##🔹 Project 7: ChatGPT Clone

The ChatGPT Clone is an interactive AI chat interface that allows users to type any query and receive a real-time response. It includes a sidebar containing useful options like starting a new chat, quick prompts such as “What is Programming?” and “How to Use API?”, and navigation sections including Home, Saved, and an Upgrade to Pro option. The chat functionality is available only inside the main chat box, allowing users to focus entirely on the conversation experience. This project highlights UI layout for chat applications and demonstrates how AI-powered chat systems can be designed for efficient user interaction.

### 🚧 Status

This project is currently under active development.
