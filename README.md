# Front-End Web Apps Series

This repository is a collection of simple front-end web applications that I'm building as part of a series to improve and showcase my front-end development skills. Each project focuses on a specific concept or utility, and more apps will be added regularly.

## ğŸ”¹ Project 1: Age Calculator

The **Age Calculator** is the first app in this series. It takes a user's date of birth and calculates their age in years, months, and days.
