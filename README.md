# Front-End Web Apps Series

This repository is a collection of simple front-end web applications that I'm building as part of a series to improve and showcase my front-end development skills. Each project focuses on a specific concept or utility, and more apps will be added regularly.

## 🔹 Project 1: Age Calculator

The **Age Calculator** is the first app in this series. It takes a user's date of birth and calculates their age in years, months, and days.

This project has not been deployed yet.

## 🔹 Project 5: Quiz App

The **Quiz App** is a general-purpose quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge on various topics. Users can answer multiple-choice questions, see their scores, and track their progress.

This project has not been deployed yet.

## 🔹 Project 6: Landing Page

The **Landing Page** is a simple responsive homepage with an interactive background. The background cycles through three different images automatically, and users can manually switch between them using dot navigation. There is also a play/pause button that allows users to control a background video. As the background changes, the text content on the page updates accordingly.

This project has not been deployed yet.
